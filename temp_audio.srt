1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,594
Glass pipe + ashes + dose of dmt ('about a third of a standard vial') + flame = :
I inhaled very deeply.

2
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:09,855
The burning DMT smelled like shit.

3
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:13,866
I immediately felt a tingly, and the whole room became soft and shiny.

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:18,432
I noticed that I could intensely hear all the static of the atmosphere surrounding me.

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,168
I felt like I need to be wearing a hood, but instead reach for a blanket and put it over me.

6
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:27,157
I said, 'I just need to hang out under this blanket for a bit guys' out loud.

7
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,736
I closed my eyes.

8
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,485
There was a lawn and a tree.

9
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:31,637
And a box.

10
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:35,520
Red bricks came out of the box's mouth and began to build a pyramid.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,541
There's a tree on the left side of me, but I could only see half of it; it looked really pixilated, like the mooninites from aqua teen hunger force.

12
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:49,066
However, most of the scenery reminded me of the art in Maurice Sendak's where the wild things are.

13
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,797
I tilted my head up and could see the sky.

14
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:54,698
I said 'the sky is beautiful - space is fucked.

15
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:55,850
' out loud.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,450
I opened my eyes.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,008
I closed them again.

18
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:04,213
I was sitting next to a river, it looked like a mosaic of pastel gel pens on black paper.

19
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:07,456
I said, 'water is amazing; I love water' out loud.

20
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:15,050
A million blightly-coloured rocks that resemble skittles rose rising out of the sand and formed different kaleidescopic pictures.

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:25,312
The rocks started to move in a tube up and up and I kept looking watching them disappear into the sky until the tube quickly jerks back towards me and it was a dragon who flied by me.

22
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:32,117
The rest of his body turned into different little streams and peak, so it appeared to me a volcano spewing purple and blue liquid.

23
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:37,770
I followed it to the right and see myself: the blue and purple are the colours of the blanket surrounding me.

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,736
I opened my eyes because I didn't want to see anymore.

25
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,613
It was fucking fantastic.
